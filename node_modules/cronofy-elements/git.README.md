## Developer documentation

To setup the development environment, run:

    make init

To start development, run:

This will watch the source files and rebuild whenever you save changes. It will also host the demo app (`demo/index.ejs`) on port `8080`

You can make a one-off development build (without watching the files or serving the demo) using:

    make build_dev

You can make a production build with:

    make build
